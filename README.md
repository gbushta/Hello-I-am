# Hello-I-am
Pygamer My name is - badge

Using adafruit-circuitpython-pybadge-en_US-5.3.0.uf2
and the related library files for version 5
adafruit-circuitpython-bundle-5.x-mpy-20200507

Included is the old version that I wrote right before
Hackaday Supercon 2019.  It would crash the PyGamer
so hard that I had to reinstall the circuitpython uf2
file. to get the badge working again.  The crash would
come in a few seconds or longer than 20 minutes.
I believe it is all fixed now.

There is also the current working version that I am
tweaking litle by little.

GreenRainRev.py is the old file
pygamer_dancing_fid.py is the newest file
